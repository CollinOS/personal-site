      <h1>Pi Setup</h1>
      <h3>An overview of my current raspberry pi setup, and the steps taken to get it running.</h3>
      <h5>10/21/2025</h5>

      <!-- TODO: Fully map out the project with graphics. Show the file structure of beelink and the pi, show which scripts run when, what backups go where. Give a full summary and breakdown with nice ai generated graphics and code snippets from scripts -->

      <p>
        My raspberry pi is going to be used as a network and monitoring hub that will later be coupled with a seperate mini pc that will act as a data/media center for my home.
      </p>
      <p>
        OS:  Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)
      </p>
      <p>
        Services:
        <ul>
          <li>Adguard Home: Network-wide ad & tracker blocking.</li>
          <li>Uptime Kuma: Will provide service monitoring for the seperate NAS device.</li>
          <li>WireGuard VPN: Allows remote secure access to my home network.</li>
          <li>Syncthing: Receive backups from my NAS device, only for photos, documents, and notes.</li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>To start you will need a 16GB+ SD card to house the operating system. If your computer doesn't have an SD card slot you'll need a SD to USB product. You will also need to download the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a> and set up a user and enable ssh.</p>
