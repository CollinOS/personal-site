      <p>Hello and welcome to my webpage. 
        I'm Collin and I'll be using this to write about topics I find interesting. 
        I've found writing to be a fun way for me to work through ideas and gather my thoughts, so this is my attempt at sharing the ones that I deem worth sharing. 
        Tech Stuff is where you'll find write ups on side projects or cool things I've worked on.
        Book Reviews will be where I write takeaways or just general thoughts on books I've read. 
        Won't have a page for every book, just the ones where I feel like I have something worth sharing about.
        Ramblings will be just that, ramblings on random topics I feel like writing about. 
      </p>
