      <h1>AI as a Learning Tool</h1>
      <h3>AI is the greatest tool for learning that humans have ever had access to.</h3>
      <h5>Date</h5>

      <p>
        I will attempt to explain the ways I've found ai useful to actually learn and level up skills as an engineer.         
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        AI allows you to get immidiate, high quality feedback on the code you write. It can give you real world problems to practice, not just LeetCode or Advent of Code style problems, real problems that you could encounter in the real world. 
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        If I was a computer science student, I would spend a few hours a week in classes slowly working my way through computer science concepts. I'd work on a coding assignment to have it graded and receive limited feedback a week later. I could go to office hours for an hour or so a week and have to filter through what is worth asking, what's not and really make the most of the time I get with the professor. With ai, there is no voice in the back of your head stopping you from asking that question that might make you look stupid, you can ask whatever you want, and get responses in a style of your choice for how you learn best. Maybe the ai occasionally misguides you, but you can't expect a human professor to answer every question you have in the best way possible either. You get instant feedback on your code and you can continue drilling down to get more an more details on what can be improved and why. What you did a good job on and why.
      </p>

      <h2>If AI can already do all of this, what's the point?</h2>
      <p>
        It is somewhat defeating to know that I'm spending countless hours working on things that ai can do in seconds, but I've kept a long-term mindset. The things I'm learning now are things that I'm never going to implement by hand (because AI), but it's going to help me progress to a point of working more and more complicated problems. In an age where the average developer is going to lean on AI so heavily that they either never learn the necessary skills to be a good developer, or they lose them from never writing code by hand, I will be here learning and leveling up my skills. I can only hope that it pays off, but I were to give up and swap careers to laying bricks, I'd look back and regret that I didn't give it my full effort.
