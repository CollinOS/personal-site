      <h1>From Developer to Cyber Security</h1>
      <h3>Documenting my experience of changing from software/ web development to cyber security.</h3>
      <h5>6/1/2025</h5>
      <p>
        I'll start by giving a brief explanation of why I decided to make the switch. I started out
        my career as a front-end developer. I enjoyed being able to do work and immediately see the
        changes in the browser. The more I learned and the better I got, the sillier I thought
        the web was. The amount of bloat and unnecessary complications involved in modern web applications led to more frustration than enjoyment. Then, my company had to let go of a back-end developer in the middle of a large project, so I stepped up to take over their workload. During this time, I came to find the back-end more enjoyable and challenging. Ultimately, the enjoyment started fading after a year or two. The day in and day out of writing code all day became redundant, and I was finding that I just wasn't passionate enough about programming to:
        a) work at it day in and day out to become truly great at it, and
        b) outpace the rapid acceleration of AI capabilities in the software field.

        Cyber security was something I had toyed with the idea of in the past, but I was hesitant to change from what I had gotten my degree in and the thought of starting back at 0 for "years of experience" was intimidating. I've always been passionate about privacy and security and the idea of actually feeling like the work I'm doing is making an impact to protect peoples data sounds much more fulfilling than what I have been doing. A friend of mine explained that (at least for threat detection) a basic explanation the work is that its like having a puzzle and needing to piece it together and tell the story of an attack, and sounds like fun.
