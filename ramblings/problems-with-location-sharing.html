      <h1>My Issues with Using Location Sharing Apps</h1>
      <h3>We are conditioning our children to be okay with their every action being tracked</h3>
      <h5>6/15/2024</h5>


      <p>
        Disclaimer: I am a young man who doesn't yet have kids. Who knows maybe some day my fear for
        my children will outweigh my disdain for tracking and the lack of privacy in the modern world, but I doubt it.
      </p>

      <p>
        We live in a world where you'll hear a lot of parents say "My kid isn't going to have a phone until they're X age. Few seem to hold up to this standard. There are two main reasons I tend to hear. First, the peer pressure from all the other kids having it. Second, so they will be able to know their kids are safe via Life360, Find my friends, or just being able to text and check on them"
      </p>

      <p>
        In doing this our kids are also not going to be able to make the mistakes that kids need to 
        make. They are being conditioned to not choose what is right and wrong for themselves. I'll
        explain what I mean. If a kid wants to tell their parents they're going one place, when in 
        actuality they want to go to another. If their parents track their every move, they can't do
        this. They aren't able to make the decision for themselves to do the right (or wrong) thing.
        This is going to contribute to a generation of people who truly won't know how to think for themselves,
        and that scares me. Couple this with the fact that gen Z is the first generation in history to have 
        lower IQ scores than the generation before them (TODO: come back and link the study), we are raising 
        a generation that is moving closer to the people in Huxley's Brave New World.

        Location tracking is one small piece of the puzzle but a contributing factor none the less. The 
        mass surveillence forced upon kids from such a young age is conditioning them for a future I would
        like to avoid. Don't think for yourself, when you do that, bad things happen. Let us think for you, 
        we know what's best, and everything will be just fine. Having doubts? I think you just need some 
        medication.
