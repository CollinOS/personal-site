      <h1>Bitcoin Buyers Guide For The Average Person</h1>
      <h3>This is meant to give a simple explantion on the things you need to know to buy and hold Bitcoin long term.</h3>

      <p>
        I think I'm supposed to say this is not financial advice, so I'll get that out of the way here. This guide is for the person who has a basic understanding of Bitcoin, and is at the point that they would like to start buying and holding it long term. If you are just buying Bitcoin because someone told you to, don't. I strongly believe that you need to understand the long term vision of the Bitcoin project, otherwise you will just lose money.
