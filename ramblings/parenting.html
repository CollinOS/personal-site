    <h1>Using trackers on your kids</h1>
    <h3>We are conditioning our children to be okay with their every action tracked</h3>

    <p>
      Disclaimer: I am a young man who doesn't yet have kids. Who knows maybe some day my fear for
      my children will outweigh my disdain for tracking and the lack of privacy in the modern world,
      but I doubt it.
    </p>

    <p>
      We live in a world where you'll hear a lot of parents say "My kid isn't going to have a phone
      until they're X age. Few seem to hold up to this standard. There are two main reasons I tend
      to hear. First, the peer pressure from all the other kids having it. Second, so they will be
      able to know their kids are safe via Life360, Find my friends, or just being able to text and
      check on them"
    </p>

    <p>
      In doing this our kids are also not going to be able to make the mistakes that kids need to 
      make. They are being conditioned to not choose what is right and wrong for themselves. I'll
      explain what I mean. If a kid wants to tell their parents they're going one place, when in 
      actuality they want to go to another. If their parents track their every move, they can't do
      this.
